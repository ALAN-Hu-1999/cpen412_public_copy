		// however in Verilog we can override the above "default output" with other outputs
		// e.g. if the address decoder is telling us that the CPU is accessing say some slow IO device (e.g. CanBusSelect_H above is logic 1), then we could delay
		// producing a Dtack back to the CPU until sometime later (i.e. introduce wait states)
		//
		// This would be done by getting the canbus controller to produce its own dtack (e.g. CanBusDtack_L above) when it it is ready
		// when this occurs we could take that CanBusDtack signals and use that to provide the dtack back the 68k
		// it could provide the DramDtack_L input that could be used to provide rthe 68k Dtack
				
		if(AS_L == 0)							// When AS active 68k is accessing something so we get to produce a Dtack here if we chose
		begin
			DtackOut_L <= 0 ;				// assume for the moment everything is fast enough, nothing needs wait states so we set DtackOut_L to low as soon as we see AS go low
													// this will be the default that covers things like on chip RAM/ROM and IO devices like LEDs, switches, graphics, DMA etc
													// this default may need changing for off chip devices like Flash, Dram etc
			
			//
			// if however the memory or IO is known to be slow and thus wait states ARE needed, i.e. we cannot just produce the dtack immediately as above
			// then we can override the above DtackOut_L <= '0' statement with another based on an IF test
			// e.g. if CanBus is being selected then take the dtack signal produced from the CanBus controller and give that to the 68k
			// However you only need to override the above default DtackOut_L <= '0' when you KNOW you need to introduce wait states
			// For devices that are fast enough NOT to need wait states, the above default will work
			// IMPORTANT - if you modify this file, realise that this circuit produces Dtack for ALL devices/chips in the system so make sure it still works for those chips after you modify this circuit
			// If your system hangs after modifications, run the simulator and check whether Dtack is being produced with each access. If not - you've screwed up
			//
			
			// here's an example that shows how we override the default DtackOut_L <= '0' above so that DtackOut_L is produced when we want (i.e. not be default)
			// in this example the dtack generator looks at the address decoder output and if the 68k is accessing the CanBus device (i.e. CanBusSelect_H equals '1')
			// we generate DtackOut_L as a copy of the signal produced by the CanBus controller (i.e. the signal CanBusDtack_L) which comes from the CanBus controller
			// we can add extra 'if' tests to cover all the other kinds of things that may need a dtack other than the default above e.g. dram controller etc
			
			if(CanBusSelect_H == 1)					// if canbus is being selected and for example it needed wait states
				DtackOut_L <= CanBusDtack_L;		// copy the dtack signal from the can controller and give this as the dtack to the 68k
