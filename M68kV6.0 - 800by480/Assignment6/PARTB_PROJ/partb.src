; *
; * Description: This function is called by either OSTaskCreate() or OSTaskCreateExt() to initialize the
; *              stack frame of the task being created.  This function is highly processor specific.
; *
; * Arguments  : task          is a pointer to the task code
; *
; *              pdata         is a pointer to a user supplied data area that will be passed to the task
; *                            when the task first executes.
; *
; *              ptos          is a pointer to the top of stack.  It is assumed that 'ptos' points to
; *                            a 'free' entry on the task stack.  If OS_STK_GROWTH is set to 1 then
; *                            'ptos' will contain the HIGHEST valid address of the stack.  Similarly, if
; *                            OS_STK_GROWTH is set to 0, the 'ptos' will contains the LOWEST valid address
; *                            of the stack.

; *              2) You can pass the above options in the 'opt' argument.  You MUST only use the upper
; *                 8 bits of 'opt' because the lower bits are reserved by uC/OS-II.  If you make changes

; *                                       PEND ON MULTIPLE EVENTS
; *
; * Description: This function waits for multiple events.  If multiple events are ready at the start of the
; *              pend call, then all available events are returned as ready.  If the task must pend on the
; *              multiple events, then only the first posted or aborted event is returned as ready.
; *
; * Arguments  : pevents_pend  is a pointer to a NULL-terminated array of event control blocks to wait for.
; *
; *              pevents_rdy   is a pointer to an array to return which event control blocks are available
; *                            or ready.  The size of the array MUST be greater than or equal to the size
; *                            of the 'pevents_pend' array, including terminating NULL.
; *
; *              pmsgs_rdy     is a pointer to an array to return messages from any available message-type
; *                            events.  The size of the array MUST be greater than or equal to the size of
; *                            the 'pevents_pend' array, excluding the terminating NULL.  Since NULL
; *                            messages are valid messages, this array cannot be NULL-terminated.  Instead,
; *                            every available message-type event returns its messages in the 'pmsgs_rdy'
; *                            array at the same index as the event is returned in the 'pevents_rdy' array.
; *                            All other 'pmsgs_rdy' array indices are filled with NULL messages.
; *
; *              timeout       is an optional timeout period (in clock ticks).  If non-zero, your task will
; *                            wait for the resources up to the amount of time specified by this argument.
; *                            If you specify 0, however, your task will wait forever for the specified
; *                            events or, until the resources becomes available (or the events occur).
; *
; *              perr          is a pointer to where an error message will be deposited.  Possible error
; *                            messages are:

; * Notes      : 1) This function should be called with interrupts already disabled

; * Arguments  : prio          is the priority of the task being created
; *
; *              ptos          is a pointer to the task's top-of-stack assuming that the CPU registers
; *                            have been placed on the stack.  Note that the top-of-stack corresponds to a
; *                            'high' memory location is OS_STK_GROWTH is set to 1 and a 'low' memory
; *                            location if OS_STK_GROWTH is set to 0.  Note that stack growth is CPU
; *                            specific.
; *
; *              pbos          is a pointer to the bottom of stack.  A NULL pointer is passed if called by

; *
; *              id            is the task's ID (0..65535)

; *                            then, 'stk_size' contains the number of bytes for the stack.  If the stack
; *                            units are INT32Us then, the stack contains '4 * stk_size' bytes.  The stack

; *                          CHECK THE STATUS OF FLAGS IN AN EVENT FLAG GROUP
; *
; * Description: This function is called to check the status of a combination of bits to be set or cleared
; *              in an event flag group.  Your application can check for ANY bit to be set/cleared or ALL
; *              bits to be set/cleared.
; *
; *              This call does not block if the desired flags are not present.
; *
; * Arguments  : pgrp          is a pointer to the desired event flag group.
; *
; *              flags         Is a bit pattern indicating which bit(s) (i.e. flags) you wish to check.
; *                            The bits you want are specified by setting the corresponding bits in
; *                            'flags'.  e.g. if your application wants to wait for bits 0 and 1 then
; *                            'flags' would contain 0x03.
; *
; *              wait_type     specifies whether you want ALL bits to be set/cleared or ANY of the bits
; *                            to be set/cleared.
; *                            You can specify the following argument:
; *
; *                            OS_FLAG_WAIT_CLR_ALL   You will check ALL bits in 'flags' to be clear (0)
; *                            OS_FLAG_WAIT_CLR_ANY   You will check ANY bit  in 'flags' to be clear (0)
; *                            OS_FLAG_WAIT_SET_ALL   You will check ALL bits in 'flags' to be set   (1)
; *                            OS_FLAG_WAIT_SET_ANY   You will check ANY bit  in 'flags' to be set   (1)
; *
; *                            NOTE: Add OS_FLAG_CONSUME if you want the event flag to be 'consumed' by
; *                                  the call.  Example, to wait for any flag in a group AND then clear
; *                                  the flags that are present, set 'wait_type' to:
; *
; *                                  OS_FLAG_WAIT_SET_ANY + OS_FLAG_CONSUME
; *
; *              perr          is a pointer to an error code and can be:
; *                            OS_ERR_NONE               No error
; *                            OS_ERR_EVENT_TYPE         You are not pointing to an event flag group
; *                            OS_ERR_FLAG_WAIT_TYPE     You didn't specify a proper 'wait_type' argument.
; *                            OS_ERR_FLAG_INVALID_PGRP  You passed a NULL pointer instead of the event flag
; *                                                      group handle.
; *                            OS_ERR_FLAG_NOT_RDY       The desired flags you are waiting for are not
; *                                                      available.
; *
; * Returns    : The flags in the event flag group that made the task ready or, 0 if a timeout or an error
; *              occurred.
; *
; * Called from: Task or ISR
; *
; * Note(s)    : 1) IMPORTANT, the behavior of this function has changed from PREVIOUS versions.  The
; *                 function NOW returns the flags that were ready INSTEAD of the current state of the
; *                 event flags.

; *                                     WAIT ON AN EVENT FLAG GROUP
; *
; * Description: This function is called to wait for a combination of bits to be set in an event flag
; *              group.  Your application can wait for ANY bit to be set or ALL bits to be set.
; *
; * Arguments  : pgrp          is a pointer to the desired event flag group.
; *
; *              flags         Is a bit pattern indicating which bit(s) (i.e. flags) you wish to wait for.
; *                            The bits you want are specified by setting the corresponding bits in
; *                            'flags'.  e.g. if your application wants to wait for bits 0 and 1 then
; *                            'flags' would contain 0x03.
; *
; *              wait_type     specifies whether you want ALL bits to be set or ANY of the bits to be set.
; *                            You can specify the following argument:
; *
; *                            OS_FLAG_WAIT_CLR_ALL   You will wait for ALL bits in 'mask' to be clear (0)
; *                            OS_FLAG_WAIT_SET_ALL   You will wait for ALL bits in 'mask' to be set   (1)
; *                            OS_FLAG_WAIT_CLR_ANY   You will wait for ANY bit  in 'mask' to be clear (0)
; *                            OS_FLAG_WAIT_SET_ANY   You will wait for ANY bit  in 'mask' to be set   (1)
; *
; *                            NOTE: Add OS_FLAG_CONSUME if you want the event flag to be 'consumed' by
; *                                  the call.  Example, to wait for any flag in a group AND then clear
; *                                  the flags that are present, set 'wait_type' to:
; *
; *                                  OS_FLAG_WAIT_SET_ANY + OS_FLAG_CONSUME
; *
; *              timeout       is an optional timeout (in clock ticks) that your task will wait for the
; *                            desired bit combination.  If you specify 0, however, your task will wait
; *                            forever at the specified event flag group or, until a message arrives.
; *
; *              perr          is a pointer to an error code and can be:
; *                            OS_ERR_NONE               The desired bits have been set within the specified
; *                                                      'timeout'.
; *                            OS_ERR_PEND_ISR           If you tried to PEND from an ISR
; *                            OS_ERR_FLAG_INVALID_PGRP  If 'pgrp' is a NULL pointer.
; *                            OS_ERR_EVENT_TYPE         You are not pointing to an event flag group

; *                            opt == OS_DEL_ALWAYS    Deletes the mailbox even if tasks are waiting.
; *                                                    In this case, all the tasks pending will be readied.

; *              (OS_EVENT *)0 if the mailbox was successfully deleted.
; *
; * Note(s)    : 1) This function must be used with care.  Tasks that would normally expect the presence of

; *              2) OSMboxAccept() callers will not know that the intended mailbox has been deleted!
; *              3) This call can potentially disable interrupts for a long time.  The interrupt disable
; *                 time is directly proportional to the number of tasks waiting on the mailbox.
; *              4) Because ALL tasks pending on the mailbox will be readied, you MUST be careful in
; *                 applications where the mailbox is used for mutual exclusion because the resource(s)
; *                 will no longer be guarded by the mailbox.

; *
; * Arguments  : pevent        is a pointer to the event control block associated with the desired mailbox
; *
; *              timeout       is an optional timeout period (in clock ticks).  If non-zero, your task will
; *                            wait for a message to arrive at the mailbox up to the amount of time
; *                            specified by this argument.  If you specify 0, however, your task will wait
; *                            forever at the specified mailbox or, until a message arrives.
; *
; *              perr          is a pointer to where an error message will be deposited.  Possible error
; *                            messages are:
; *
; *                            OS_ERR_NONE         The call was successful and your task received a
; *                                                message.
; *                            OS_ERR_TIMEOUT      A message was not received within the specified 'timeout'.
; *                            OS_ERR_PEND_ABORT   The wait on the mailbox was aborted.
; *                            OS_ERR_EVENT_TYPE   Invalid event type
; *                            OS_ERR_PEND_ISR     If you called this function from an ISR and the result
; *                                                would lead to a suspension.
; *                            OS_ERR_PEVENT_NULL  If 'pevent' is a NULL pointer
; *                            OS_ERR_PEND_LOCKED  If you called this function when the scheduler is locked
; *
; * Returns    : != (void *)0  is a pointer to the message received
; *              == (void *)0  if no message was received or,
; *                            if 'pevent' is a NULL pointer or,
; *                            if you didn't pass the proper pointer to the event control block.

; * Description : Create a fixed-sized memory partition that will be managed by uC/OS-II.
; *
; * Arguments   : addr     is the starting address of the memory partition
; *
; *               nblks    is the number of memory blocks to create from the partition.
; *
; *               blksize  is the size (in bytes) of each block in the memory partition.
; *
; *               perr     is a pointer to a variable containing an error message which will be set by
; *                        this function to either:
; *
; *                        OS_ERR_NONE              if the memory partition has been created correctly.
; *                        OS_ERR_MEM_INVALID_ADDR  if you are specifying an invalid address for the memory
; *                                                 storage of the partition or, the block does not align

; * Arguments  : pevent     is a pointer to the event control block
; *
; *              perr       is a pointer to an error code which will be returned to your application:
; *                            OS_ERR_NONE         if the call was successful.
; *                            OS_ERR_EVENT_TYPE   if 'pevent' is not a pointer to a mutex
; *                            OS_ERR_PEVENT_NULL  'pevent' is a NULL pointer
; *                            OS_ERR_PEND_ISR     if you called this function from an ISR
; *                            OS_ERR_PCP_LOWER    If the priority of the task that owns the Mutex is
; *                                                HIGHER (i.e. a lower number) than the PCP.  This error
; *                                                indicates that you did not set the PCP higher (lower
; *                                                number) than ALL the tasks that compete for the Mutex.
; *                                                Unfortunately, this is something that could not be
; *                                                detected when the Mutex is created because we don't know
; *                                                what tasks will be using the Mutex.
; *
; * Returns    : == OS_TRUE    if the resource is available, the mutual exclusion semaphore is acquired
; *              == OS_FALSE   a) if the resource is not available
; *                            b) you didn't pass a pointer to a mutual exclusion semaphore
; *                            c) you called this function from an ISR

; *                            semaphore is raised to this priority.  It is assumed that you will specify
; *                            a priority that is LOWER in value than ANY of the tasks competing for the
; *                            mutex. If the priority is specified as OS_PRIO_MUTEX_CEIL_DIS, then the
; *                            priority ceiling promotion is disabled. This way, the tasks accessing the
; *                            semaphore do not have their priority promoted.
; *
; *              perr          is a pointer to an error code which will be returned to your application:

; *                               OS_ERR_PRIO_EXIST   if a task at the priority ceiling priority
; *                                                   already exist.
; *                               OS_ERR_PEVENT_NULL  No more event control blocks available.
; *                               OS_ERR_PRIO_INVALID if the priority you specify is higher that the

; * Arguments  : pevent        is a pointer to the event control block associated with the desired mutex.
; *

; *                            opt == OS_DEL_ALWAYS    Deletes the mutex even if tasks are waiting.
; *                                                    In this case, all the tasks pending will be readied.

; *                            OS_ERR_NONE             The call was successful and the mutex was deleted
; *                            OS_ERR_DEL_ISR          If you attempted to delete the MUTEX from an ISR
; *                            OS_ERR_INVALID_OPT      An invalid option was specified
; *                            OS_ERR_TASK_WAITING     One or more tasks were waiting on the mutex
; *                            OS_ERR_EVENT_TYPE       If you didn't pass a pointer to a mutex
; *                            OS_ERR_PEVENT_NULL      If 'pevent' is a NULL pointer.
; *
; * Returns    : pevent        upon error
; *              (OS_EVENT *)0 if the mutex was successfully deleted.
; *
; * Note(s)    : 1) This function must be used with care.  Tasks that would normally expect the presence of
; *                 the mutex MUST check the return code of OSMutexPend().
; *
; *              2) This call can potentially disable interrupts for a long time.  The interrupt disable
; *                 time is directly proportional to the number of tasks waiting on the mutex.
; *
; *              3) Because ALL tasks pending on the mutex will be readied, you MUST be careful because the
; *                 resource(s) will no longer be guarded by the mutex.
; *
; *              4) IMPORTANT: In the 'OS_DEL_ALWAYS' case, we assume that the owner of the Mutex (if there
; *                            is one) is ready-to-run and is thus NOT pending on another kernel object or
; *                            has delayed itself.  In other words, if a task owns the mutex being deleted,
; *                            that task will be made ready-to-run at its original priority.

; *
; * Description: This function waits for a mutual exclusion semaphore.
; *
; * Arguments  : pevent        is a pointer to the event control block associated with the desired
; *                            mutex.
; *
; *              timeout       is an optional timeout period (in clock ticks).  If non-zero, your task will
; *                            wait for the resource up to the amount of time specified by this argument.
; *                            If you specify 0, however, your task will wait forever at the specified
; *                            mutex or, until the resource becomes available.
; *
; *              perr          is a pointer to where an error message will be deposited.  Possible error
; *                            messages are:
; *                               OS_ERR_NONE        The call was successful and your task owns the mutex
; *                               OS_ERR_TIMEOUT     The mutex was not available within the specified 'timeout'.
; *                               OS_ERR_PEND_ABORT  The wait on the mutex was aborted.
; *                               OS_ERR_EVENT_TYPE  If you didn't pass a pointer to a mutex
; *                               OS_ERR_PEVENT_NULL 'pevent' is a NULL pointer
; *                               OS_ERR_PEND_ISR    If you called this function from an ISR and the result
; *                                                  would lead to a suspension.
; *                               OS_ERR_PCP_LOWER   If the priority of the task that owns the Mutex is
; *                                                  HIGHER (i.e. a lower number) than the PCP.  This error
; *                                                  indicates that you did not set the PCP higher (lower
; *                                                  number) than ALL the tasks that compete for the Mutex.
; *                                                  Unfortunately, this is something that could not be
; *                                                  detected when the Mutex is created because we don't know
; *                                                  what tasks will be using the Mutex.
; *                               OS_ERR_PEND_LOCKED If you called this function when the scheduler is locked
; *
; * Returns    : none
; *
; * Note(s)    : 1) The task that owns the Mutex MUST NOT pend on any other event while it owns the mutex.
; *

; *                            OS_ERR_EVENT_TYPE   You didn't pass a pointer to a queue

; *                            OS_ERR_Q_EMPTY      The queue did not contain any messages
; *
; * Returns    : != (void *)0  is the message in the queue if one is available.  The message is removed
; *                            from the so the next time OSQAccept() is called, the queue will contain
; *                            one less entry.
; *              == (void *)0  if you received a NULL pointer message

; *                            queue.

; *                            opt == OS_DEL_ALWAYS    Deletes the queue even if tasks are waiting.
; *                                                    In this case, all the tasks pending will be readied.

; *                            OS_ERR_NONE             The call was successful and the queue was deleted
; *                            OS_ERR_DEL_ISR          If you tried to delete the queue from an ISR
; *                            OS_ERR_INVALID_OPT      An invalid option was specified
; *                            OS_ERR_TASK_WAITING     One or more tasks were waiting on the queue
; *                            OS_ERR_EVENT_TYPE       If you didn't pass a pointer to a queue
; *                            OS_ERR_PEVENT_NULL      If 'pevent' is a NULL pointer.
; *
; * Returns    : pevent        upon error
; *              (OS_EVENT *)0 if the queue was successfully deleted.
; *
; * Note(s)    : 1) This function must be used with care.  Tasks that would normally expect the presence of
; *                 the queue MUST check the return code of OSQPend().
; *              2) OSQAccept() callers will not know that the intended queue has been deleted unless
; *                 they check 'pevent' to see that it's a NULL pointer.
; *              3) This call can potentially disable interrupts for a long time.  The interrupt disable
; *                 time is directly proportional to the number of tasks waiting on the queue.
; *              4) Because ALL tasks pending on the queue will be readied, you MUST be careful in
; *                 applications where the queue is used for mutual exclusion because the resource(s)
; *                 will no longer be guarded by the queue.
; *              5) If the storage for the message queue was allocated dynamically (i.e. using a malloc()
; *                 type call) then your application MUST release the memory storage by call the counterpart
; *                 call of the dynamic allocation scheme used.  If the queue storage was created statically
; *                 then, the storage can be reused.
; *              6) All tasks that were waiting for the queue will be readied and returned an

; *              the queue via OSQPost(), OSQPostFront() or OSQPostOpt().
; *
; * Arguments  : pevent        is a pointer to the event control block associated with the desired queue.
; *
; *              opt           determines the type of ABORT performed:
; *                            OS_PEND_OPT_NONE         ABORT wait for a single task (HPT) waiting on the
; *                                                     queue

; *
; *              perr          is a pointer to where an error message will be deposited.  Possible error
; *                            messages are:
; *
; *                            OS_ERR_NONE         No tasks were     waiting on the queue.
; *                            OS_ERR_PEND_ABORT   At least one task waiting on the queue was readied
; *                                                and informed of the aborted wait; check return value
; *                                                for the number of tasks whose wait on the queue
; *                                                was aborted.
; *                            OS_ERR_EVENT_TYPE   If you didn't pass a pointer to a queue.
; *                            OS_ERR_PEVENT_NULL  If 'pevent' is a NULL pointer.

; * Returns    : == 0          if no tasks were waiting on the queue, or upon error.
; *              >  0          if one or more tasks waiting on the queue are now readied and informed.

; *
; * Description: This function sends a message to a queue.  This call has been added to reduce code size
; *              since it can replace both OSQPost() and OSQPostFront().  Also, this function adds the
; *              capability to broadcast a message to ALL tasks waiting on the message queue.
; *
; * Arguments  : pevent        is a pointer to the event control block associated with the desired queue
; *
; *              pmsg          is a pointer to the message to send.
; *
; *              opt           determines the type of POST performed:
; *                            OS_POST_OPT_NONE         POST to a single waiting task
; *                                                     (Identical to OSQPost())
; *                            OS_POST_OPT_BROADCAST    POST to ALL tasks that are waiting on the queue
; *                            OS_POST_OPT_FRONT        POST as LIFO (Simulates OSQPostFront())
; *                            OS_POST_OPT_NO_SCHED     Indicates that the scheduler will NOT be invoked
; *
; * Returns    : OS_ERR_NONE           The call was successful and the message was sent
; *              OS_ERR_Q_FULL         If the queue cannot accept any more messages because it is full.
; *              OS_ERR_EVENT_TYPE     If you didn't pass a pointer to a queue.
; *              OS_ERR_PEVENT_NULL    If 'pevent' is a NULL pointer
; *
; * Warning    : Interrupts can be disabled for a long time if you do a 'broadcast'.  In fact, the
; *              interrupt disable time is proportional to the number of tasks waiting on the queue.

; *                            opt == OS_DEL_ALWAYS    Deletes the semaphore even if tasks are waiting.
; *                                                    In this case, all the tasks pending will be readied.

; *                            OS_ERR_PEVENT_NULL      If 'pevent' is a NULL pointer.
; *
; * Returns    : pevent        upon error
; *              (OS_EVENT *)0 if the semaphore was successfully deleted.
; *
; * Note(s)    : 1) This function must be used with care.  Tasks that would normally expect the presence of
; *                 the semaphore MUST check the return code of OSSemPend().
; *              2) OSSemAccept() callers will not know that the intended semaphore has been deleted unless
; *                 they check 'pevent' to see that it's a NULL pointer.
; *              3) This call can potentially disable interrupts for a long time.  The interrupt disable
; *                 time is directly proportional to the number of tasks waiting on the semaphore.
; *              4) Because ALL tasks pending on the semaphore will be readied, you MUST be careful in
; *                 applications where the semaphore is used for mutual exclusion because the resource(s)
; *                 will no longer be guarded by the semaphore.
; *              5) All tasks that were waiting for the semaphore will be readied and returned an

; *                            OS_ERR_EVENT_TYPE   If you didn't pass a pointer to a semaphore.
; *                            OS_ERR_PEND_ISR     If you called this function from an ISR and the result
; *                                                would lead to a suspension.

; * Arguments  : oldp     is the old priority
; *
; *              newp     is the new priority
; *
; * Returns    : OS_ERR_NONE            is the call was successful
; *              OS_ERR_PRIO_INVALID    if the priority you specify is higher that the maximum allowed
; *                                     (i.e. >= OS_LOWEST_PRIO)
; *              OS_ERR_PRIO_EXIST      if the new priority already exist.
; *              OS_ERR_PRIO            there is no task with the specified OLD priority (i.e. the OLD task does
; *                                     not exist.

; *                                            CREATE A TASK
; *
; * Description: This function is used to have uC/OS-II manage the execution of a task.  Tasks can either
; *              be created prior to the start of multitasking or by a running task.  A task cannot be
; *              created by an ISR.
; *
; * Arguments  : task     is a pointer to the task's code
; *
; *              p_arg    is a pointer to an optional data area which can be used to pass parameters to
; *                       the task when the task first executes.  Where the task is concerned it thinks
; *                       it was invoked and passed the argument 'p_arg' as follows:
; *
; *                           void Task (void *p_arg)
; *                           {
; *                               for (;;) {
; *                                   Task code;
; *                               }
; *                           }
; *
; *              ptos     is a pointer to the task's top of stack.  If the configuration constant
; *                       OS_STK_GROWTH is set to 1, the stack is assumed to grow downward (i.e. from high
; *                       memory to low memory).  'pstk' will thus point to the highest (valid) memory
; *                       location of the stack.  If OS_STK_GROWTH is set to 0, 'pstk' will point to the
; *                       lowest memory location of the stack and the stack will grow with increasing
; *                       memory locations.
; *
; *              prio     is the task's priority.  A unique priority MUST be assigned to each task and the
; *                       lower the number, the higher the priority.
; *
; * Returns    : OS_ERR_NONE                      if the function was successful.
; *              OS_ERR_PRIO_EXIST                if the task priority already exist
; *                                               (each task MUST have a unique priority).
; *              OS_ERR_PRIO_INVALID              if the priority you specify is higher that the maximum
; *                                               allowed (i.e. >= OS_LOWEST_PRIO)
; *              OS_ERR_TASK_CREATE_ISR           if you tried to create a task from an ISR.
; *              OS_ERR_ILLEGAL_CREATE_RUN_TIME   if you tried to create a task after safety critical
; *                                               operation started.

; *                                  CREATE A TASK (Extended Version)
; *
; * Description: This function is used to have uC/OS-II manage the execution of a task.  Tasks can either
; *              be created prior to the start of multitasking or by a running task.  A task cannot be
; *              created by an ISR.  This function is similar to OSTaskCreate() except that it allows
; *              additional information about a task to be specified.
; *
; * Arguments  : task      is a pointer to the task's code
; *
; *              p_arg     is a pointer to an optional data area which can be used to pass parameters to
; *                        the task when the task first executes.  Where the task is concerned it thinks
; *                        it was invoked and passed the argument 'p_arg' as follows:
; *
; *                            void Task (void *p_arg)
; *                            {
; *                                for (;;) {
; *                                    Task code;
; *                                }
; *                            }
; *
; *              ptos      is a pointer to the task's top of stack.  If the configuration constant
; *                        OS_STK_GROWTH is set to 1, the stack is assumed to grow downward (i.e. from high
; *                        memory to low memory).  'ptos' will thus point to the highest (valid) memory
; *                        location of the stack.  If OS_STK_GROWTH is set to 0, 'ptos' will point to the
; *                        lowest memory location of the stack and the stack will grow with increasing
; *                        memory locations.  'ptos' MUST point to a valid 'free' data item.
; *
; *              prio      is the task's priority.  A unique priority MUST be assigned to each task and the
; *                        lower the number, the higher the priority.
; *
; *              id        is the task's ID (0..65535)
; *
; *              pbos      is a pointer to the task's bottom of stack.  If the configuration constant
; *                        OS_STK_GROWTH is set to 1, the stack is assumed to grow downward (i.e. from high
; *                        memory to low memory).  'pbos' will thus point to the LOWEST (valid) memory
; *                        location of the stack.  If OS_STK_GROWTH is set to 0, 'pbos' will point to the
; *                        HIGHEST memory location of the stack and the stack will grow with increasing
; *                        memory locations.  'pbos' MUST point to a valid 'free' data item.
; *
; *              stk_size  is the size of the stack in number of elements.  If OS_STK is set to INT8U,
; *                        'stk_size' corresponds to the number of bytes available.  If OS_STK is set to
; *                        INT16U, 'stk_size' contains the number of 16-bit entries available.  Finally, if
; *                        OS_STK is set to INT32U, 'stk_size' contains the number of 32-bit entries
; *                        available on the stack.
; *
; *              pext      is a pointer to a user supplied memory location which is used as a TCB extension.
; *                        For example, this user memory can hold the contents of floating-point registers
; *                        during a context switch, the time each task takes to execute, the number of times
; *                        the task has been switched-in, etc.
; *
; *              opt       contains additional information (or options) about the behavior of the task.  The
; *                        LOWER 8-bits are reserved by uC/OS-II while the upper 8 bits can be application
; *                        specific.  See OS_TASK_OPT_??? in uCOS-II.H.  Current choices are:
; *
; *                        OS_TASK_OPT_STK_CHK      Stack checking to be allowed for the task
; *                        OS_TASK_OPT_STK_CLR      Clear the stack when the task is created
; *                        OS_TASK_OPT_SAVE_FP      If the CPU has floating-point registers, save them
; *                                                 during a context switch.
; *
; * Returns    : OS_ERR_NONE                      if the function was successful.
; *              OS_ERR_PRIO_EXIST                if the task priority already exist
; *                                               (each task MUST have a unique priority).
; *              OS_ERR_PRIO_INVALID              if the priority you specify is higher that the maximum
; *                                               allowed (i.e. > OS_LOWEST_PRIO)
; *              OS_ERR_TASK_CREATE_ISR           if you tried to create a task from an ISR.
; *              OS_ERR_ILLEGAL_CREATE_RUN_TIME   if you tried to create a task after safety critical
; *                                               operation started.

; *                                            DELETE A TASK
; *
; * Description: This function allows you to delete a task.  The calling task can delete itself by
; *              its own priority number.  The deleted task is returned to the dormant state and can be
; *              re-activated by creating the deleted task again.
; *
; * Arguments  : prio    is the priority of the task to delete.  Note that you can explicitly delete
; *                      the current task without knowing its priority level by setting 'prio' to
; *                      OS_PRIO_SELF.
; *
; * Returns    : OS_ERR_NONE             if the call is successful
; *              OS_ERR_TASK_DEL_IDLE    if you attempted to delete uC/OS-II's idle task
; *              OS_ERR_PRIO_INVALID     if the priority you specify is higher that the maximum allowed
; *                                      (i.e. >= OS_LOWEST_PRIO) or, you have not specified OS_PRIO_SELF.
; *              OS_ERR_TASK_DEL         if the task is assigned to a Mutex PIP.
; *              OS_ERR_TASK_NOT_EXIST   if the task you want to delete does not exist.
; *              OS_ERR_TASK_DEL_ISR     if you tried to delete a task from an ISR
; *
; * Notes      : 1) To reduce interrupt latency, OSTaskDel() 'disables' the task:
; *                    a) by making it not ready
; *                    b) by removing it from any wait lists
; *                    c) by preventing OSTimeTick() from making the task ready to run.
; *                 The task can then be 'unlinked' from the miscellaneous structures in uC/OS-II.
; *              2) The function OS_Dummy() is called after OS_EXIT_CRITICAL() because, on most processors,
; *                 the next instruction following the enable interrupt instruction is ignored.
; *              3) An ISR cannot delete a task.
; *              4) The lock nesting counter is incremented because, for a brief instant, if the current
; *                 task is being deleted, the current task would not be able to be rescheduled because it
; *                 is removed from the ready list.  Incrementing the nesting counter prevents another task
; *                 from being schedule.  This means that an ISR would return to the current task which is
; *                 being deleted.  The rest of the deletion would thus be able to be completed.

; *                                  REQUEST THAT A TASK DELETE ITSELF
; *
; * Description: This function is used to:
; *                   a) notify a task to delete itself.
; *                   b) to see if a task requested that the current task delete itself.
; *              This function is a little tricky to understand.  Basically, you have a task that needs
; *              to be deleted however, this task has resources that it has allocated (memory buffers,
; *              semaphores, mailboxes, queues etc.).  The task cannot be deleted otherwise these
; *              resources would not be freed.  The requesting task calls OSTaskDelReq() to indicate that
; *              the task needs to be deleted.  Deleting of the task is however, deferred to the task to
; *              be deleted.  For example, suppose that task #10 needs to be deleted.  The requesting task
; *              example, task #5, would call OSTaskDelReq(10).  When task #10 gets to execute, it calls
; *              this function by specifying OS_PRIO_SELF and monitors the returned value.  If the return
; *              value is OS_ERR_TASK_DEL_REQ, another task requested a task delete.  Task #10 would look like
; *              this:
; *
; *                   void Task(void *p_arg)
; *                   {
; *                       .
; *                       .
; *                       while (1) {
; *                           OSTimeDly(1);
; *                           if (OSTaskDelReq(OS_PRIO_SELF) == OS_ERR_TASK_DEL_REQ) {
; *                               Release any owned resources;
; *                               De-allocate any dynamic memory;
; *                               OSTaskDel(OS_PRIO_SELF);
; *                           }
; *                       }
; *                   }
; *
; * Arguments  : prio    is the priority of the task to request the delete from
; *
; * Returns    : OS_ERR_NONE            if the task exist and the request has been registered
; *              OS_ERR_TASK_NOT_EXIST  if the task has been deleted.  This allows the caller to know whether
; *                                     the request has been executed.
; *              OS_ERR_TASK_DEL        if the task is assigned to a Mutex.
; *              OS_ERR_TASK_DEL_IDLE   if you requested to delete uC/OS-II's idle task
; *              OS_ERR_PRIO_INVALID    if the priority you specify is higher that the maximum allowed
; *                                     (i.e. >= OS_LOWEST_PRIO) or, you have not specified OS_PRIO_SELF.
; *              OS_ERR_TASK_DEL_REQ    if a task (possibly another task) requested that the running task be
; *                                     deleted.

; *                                    DELAY TASK FOR SPECIFIED TIME
; *
; * Description: This function is called to delay execution of the currently running task until some time
; *              expires.  This call allows you to specify the delay time in HOURS, MINUTES, SECONDS and
; *              MILLISECONDS instead of ticks.
; *
; * Arguments  : hours     specifies the number of hours that the task will be delayed (max. is 255)
; *              minutes   specifies the number of minutes (max. 59)
; *              seconds   specifies the number of seconds (max. 59)
; *              ms        specifies the number of milliseconds (max. 999)
; *
; * Returns    : OS_ERR_NONE
; *              OS_ERR_TIME_INVALID_MINUTES
; *              OS_ERR_TIME_INVALID_SECONDS
; *              OS_ERR_TIME_INVALID_MS
; *              OS_ERR_TIME_ZERO_DLY
; *              OS_ERR_TIME_DLY_ISR
; *
; * Note(s)    : The resolution on the milliseconds depends on the tick rate.  For example, you can't do
; *              a 10 mS delay if the ticker interrupts every 100 mS.  In this case, the delay would be
; *              set to 0.  The actual delay is rounded to the nearest tick.

; *                                           CREATE A TIMER
; *
; * Description: This function is called by your application code to create a timer.
; *
; * Arguments  : dly           Initial delay.
; *                            If the timer is configured for ONE-SHOT mode, this is the timeout used.
; *                            If the timer is configured for PERIODIC mode, this is the first timeout to 
; *                               wait for before the timer starts entering periodic mode.
; *
; *              period        The 'period' being repeated for the timer.
; *                               If you specified 'OS_TMR_OPT_PERIODIC' as an option, when the timer 
; *                               expires, it will automatically restart with the same period.
; *
; *              opt           Specifies either:
; *                               OS_TMR_OPT_ONE_SHOT       The timer counts down only once
; *                               OS_TMR_OPT_PERIODIC       The timer counts down and then reloads itself
; *
; *              callback      Is a pointer to a callback function that will be called when the timer expires. 
; *                               The callback function must be declared as follows:
; *
; *                               void MyCallback (OS_TMR *ptmr, void *p_arg);
; *
; *              callback_arg  Is an argument (a pointer) that is passed to the callback function when it is called.
; *
; *              pname         Is a pointer to an ASCII string that is used to name the timer.  Names are 
; *                               useful for debugging.
; *
; *              perr          Is a pointer to an error code.  '*perr' will contain one of the following:
; *                               OS_ERR_NONE
; *                               OS_ERR_TMR_INVALID_DLY     you specified an invalid delay
; *                               OS_ERR_TMR_INVALID_PERIOD  you specified an invalid period
; *                               OS_ERR_TMR_INVALID_OPT     you specified an invalid option
; *                               OS_ERR_TMR_ISR             if the call was made from an ISR
; *                               OS_ERR_TMR_NON_AVAIL       if there are no free timers from the timer pool
; *
; * Returns    : A pointer to an OS_TMR data structure.
; *              This is the 'handle' that your application will use to reference the timer created.
