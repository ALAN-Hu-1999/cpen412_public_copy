Why benchmarks?
==============
Benchmark programs are relatively small programs that have no other purpose than to measure the execution
time of the compiler/CPU combination. They do not compute something usefull. Benchmarks date from the 1970's
and 1980's when computer and compiler development were at its highdays. Since then, computer design has matured
and compiler principles are well understood. Benchmarks are interesting in the context of IDE68K because
it has a simulated CPU as central processor, an ordinary C-language program in fact. Two benchmarks are provided,
the Whetstone benchmark with floating point operations and the Dhrystone benchmark with exclusively integer
operations. For comparision, the same benchmarks are also compiled to run directly on the PC (.EXE files).

Whetstone Benchmark
===================
The Whetstone benchmark was written by Harold Curnow of CCTA, the British government computer
procurement agency, based on work by Brian Wichmann of the National Physical Laboratory.
An Algol version of the benchmark was released in November 1972 and Fortran single and double
precision varieties in April 1973. The Fortran codes became the first general purpose benchmarks
that set industry standards of performance.

The benchmark produced speed ratings in terms of Thousands of Whetstone Instructions Per Second (KWIPS).
In 1978, self timing versions (by Roy Longbottom also of CCTA) produced speed ratings in MOPS
(Millions of Operations Per Second) and MFLOPS (Floating Point) and overall rating in MWIPS

Whetstone benchmark source code can also be downloaded in programming languages like Fortran, C, Basic, Java,
Visual Basic, Excel Spreadsheet Visual Basic and others. These are all of the same sort of format with self
timing for PC's. Please excuse all code is looking like Fortran.

Dhrystone Benchmark
===================
The Dhrystone "C" benchmark, a sort of Whetstone without floating point, became the key standard benchmark,
from 1984, with the growth of Unix systems. The first version was produced by Reinhold P. Weicker in ADA and
translated to "C" by Rick Richardson.

Two versions are available, Dhrystone versions 1.1 and 2.1. The second version was produced to avoid
over-optimization problems encountered with version 1. Although it is recommended that advanced optimization
levels should be avoided with the latter, it is clear from published results that the recommendation is
usually ignored.

Original versions of the benchmark gave performance ratings in terms of Dhrystones per second. This was
later changed to VAX MIPS by dividing Dhrystones per second by 1600, the average DEC VAX 11/780 result.
